# LLM Spotlight

Spotlight but powered via an LLM

## Why?

1. v1 Be able to ask open ended question of all (maybe just specified directories) saved on my computer

2. v2 Execute queries like “move all image files from last month to archive”

3. v2 Be able to say things like "based on these files, do something cool"
