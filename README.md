# LlmFS

LLM-based file system

## Why?

I want something that

1. I want something that can generate representations of file contents to help with retrieval

2. Able to organize files based on context

3. Be able to ask open ended question of all files in an OS

4. Execute queries like “move all image files from last month to archive”
